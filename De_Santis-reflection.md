#GPS 1.1

##What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* The git concept I struggled with most was when to start a new branch and when to use a current one. I was also confused merging branches from your local computer.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* Both of these concepts were clarified by my pair partner and my GPS guild.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
* I asked my group when the right time to start a new branch is. Also what types of markdown commands we needed to use.

##What still confuses you about Git?
* I don't feel confused about Git anymore. I feel like this assignment answered my questions.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* I really enjoyed my first GPS. It allowed me to learn new things with my partner while ensuring it was the correct answer because our guide was looking over us.
