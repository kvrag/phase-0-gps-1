#GPS 1.1 Reflection
##Kristina Vragovic

* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Prior to the session, I was having some trouble wrapping my head around the basic order of commands within the terminal. Conceptually, I understood what a branch is and its purpose, as well as what it meant to merge a branch with the master. However, when I got into the terminal and wanted to work on a project and save my steps the proper way, it would take me a while (and lots of referencing my notes) to recall the commands and the order of operations.

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I noticed that as I was working on my solo challenges, sometimes a merge would trigger a pull request, and sometimes it wouldn't. I think I am clear now -- and please correct me in the comments if I'm wrong -- when you merge a branch onto the master within the terminal, and then push the master to GitHub, it does not create a pull request automatically. But when you push an updated branch up into GitHub, it creates a pull request to merge that branch onto the master. I hope that's right!

* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I tried to keep questions open-ended in case my pair, Enrico, had an answer, before turning to our guide specifically. My questions were mostly about git syntax, as I hadn't yet encountered `git fetch` and wasn't sure how to complete the command. We also discussed what I explained above, about merging and creating pull requests. I also made sure to ask/check with Enrico throughout my time as a driver, to make sure I wasn't going too fast or without thinking it through.

* **What still confuses you about Git?**

I don't think I'm quite clear on the difference between a fetch and a pull. It seems like there's a nuance there that I'm not getting.

* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I think it went really well. Enrico was easy to pair with, and Bison chimed in only when we really got stuck, which I thought was great (and probably took a lot of restraint, haha). Everyone was really respectful, and I liked that Bison gave feedback on our feedback. So far there hasn't been much immediate feedback on our work, so that was refreshing and helped ease my mind.
